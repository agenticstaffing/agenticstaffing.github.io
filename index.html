            <h2>The Golden Ratio</h2>
            <p>We believe in a <strong>trustworthy</strong> approach to AI.</p>
            <p>Instead of the "vibe-based" methods often associated with tools like Devin or Lovable, we focus on the <strong>Golden Ratio</strong> of AI to human supervision.</p>
            <p>This ensures that while you leverage the speed and scale of AI, you maintain the accountability, quality assurance, and strategic oversight that only expert human supervision can provide.</p>
